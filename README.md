## Overview
This project seeks to create a model that classifies Sentiment of a given movie review is Positive or Negative . This information will help Movie Production House to analyze reviews from viewers around various social networking platform.


## Business Problem
Movie Production House can get Average user rating of their movies from websites like IMDb, Google Reviews and Yelp. But to get the Overall Sentiment and Word Of Mouth from social networking sites can be quite painful as reviews are available in the form of text and not ratings (numbers).

Reviews with rating 1,2,3 were labeled as Negative and reviews with rating 8,9,10 were labeled as Positive.

250K Reviews were used for the analysis.
